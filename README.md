This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project to easily share your ranked values for a variety of categories, helping people understand each other better.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Improvements

- Routes could be params rather than search params for actual resources
- /ranking/edit and /ranking/new should reuse components instead of /edit importing /new's page component entirely (hack)

## Deployed on Vercel
