This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project to easily share your ranked values for a variety of categories, helping people understand each other better.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Improvements

- Routes could be params rather than search params for actual resources
- /ranking/edit and /ranking/new should reuse components instead of /edit importing /new's page component entirely (hack)

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
